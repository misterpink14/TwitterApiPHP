# TwitterApiPHP
Connect to twitter's api via PHP.

This is kind of a quick and dirty was of connecting to Twitter's api. 
There are other solutions that are probably better if your interested in security. 
Those solutions, however, are much easier to find than this one.

You absolutely need a Twitter dev account and App since Twitter went RESTful with their new api. I'm assuming they weren't before.
